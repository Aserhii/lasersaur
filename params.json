{"name":"Lasersaur","tagline":"Lasersaur -- open source laser cutter","body":"Lasersaur Manual (beta)\r\n===============\r\n\r\nThis manual is the main resource for both **building and maintaining** a Lasersaur laser cutter. The basic idea is, when you build it you can easily maintain it. The other idea is that an open source design can improve over time through the collaboration of many people. We hope in three years it will have evolved to the point where it has multiple robotic arms sticking out capable of building space stations :) \r\n\r\n![Lasersaur](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8142/7139599325_1b7036b97e_n.jpg)![Lasersaur](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8156/7139609703_b8134916f2_n.jpg)\r\n\r\n* Specifications\r\n  * [System Overview](overview)\r\n  * [Bill of Materials](bom)\r\n  * [G-code Communication](gcode)\r\n  * [DriveBoard Electronics](driveboard) \r\n  * [Revisions and Roadmap](revisions)\r\n* Building Process\r\n  * [Getting Started](start)\r\n  * [Build Instructions](assembly)\r\n  * [Setting up the Software](lasaurapp)\r\n  * [Accessories](accessories)\r\n* Operation\r\n  * [Running a Lasersaur](operation)\r\n  * [Adjusting the Optics](optics_setup)\r\n  * [Laser Adjustments](laser_adjustments)\r\n  * [Timing Belt Adjustments](timing_belts)\r\n  * [LaserTags](lasertags)\r\n* Community\r\n  * [Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lasersaur) - join the discourse!\r\n  * [Map of Builders](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=212793647571970047289.0004a1eb83351b9926511&msa=0) - add yourself!\r\n  * [Flickr Group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/lasersaur/) - add your images!\r\n  * [Vimeo Videos](https://vimeo.com/search/sort:date/format:thumbnail?q=lasersaur) - tag your videos \"lasersaur\"\r\n  * [Materials List](https://sites.google.com/site/lasersaurmaterialswiki) - add your materials!\r\n  * ---\r\n  * [ITP's photo documentation](http://www.flickr.com/photos/greentulips/sets/72157630003201811/)\r\n  * [Pax Modern's photo documentation](http://www.flickr.com/photos/77171978@N02/sets/72157629442984600/)\r\n  * [CW&T's photo documentation](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cwwang/sets/72157630319998790/)\r\n* Downloads\r\n  * [LasaurApp](https://github.com/stefanix/LasaurApp)\r\n* Other Docs\r\n  * [Time-Lapse of the Build](http://vimeo.com/23935409)\r\n  * [more lasersaur pr0n](http://vimeo.com/23871399)\r\n  * [Old Step-by-Step Photo Instructions](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stfnix/sets/72157626580353027/)\r\n  * [Staging Area for new Manual Entries](staging_area)\r\n* History\r\n  * [Development Process](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stfnix/sets/72157624491114826/) and early prototyping \r\n* Exclusive to Supporters\r\n  * CAD Model\r\n  * Extensive Mailing List\r\n  * Please consider [supporting the project](/lasersaur/#feed)\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wire\">\r\n<span style=\"font-size:1.2em\">DISCLAIMER:</span> Please be aware that operating a self-built laser cutter can be dangerous and requires full awareness of the risks involved.
