LasaurApp is the main control app for the Lasersaur. It is installed on the Lasersaur and accessed over the local network (ethernet or wifi) with a web browser. A Lasersaur typically does not require any software or driver installation on the user's computer. Simply point a web browser to: [http://lasersaur.local](http://lasersaur.local).

The main features are as follows:

- send vector files to the Lasersaur
- import files and optimize
- supported file formats are: SVG, G-Code ([subset](gcode.md)), DXF ([subset](dxf_import.md))
- GUI for moving/jogging the laser head
- stopping/pausing/continuing jobs
- firmware flashing
- handy G-code programs for the optics calibration process
