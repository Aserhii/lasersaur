Note: We have been switching stepper motors quite a bit over the version number. Make sure to double-check the part numbers accordingly.

* shaft length 90.1mm (tip front to tip rear shaft)
* current (bipolar, series) 2.1A
* Vmax = 32*sqrt(4.4) = 67V
* Amax = 0.67*2.1 = 1.4A (required power supply)
