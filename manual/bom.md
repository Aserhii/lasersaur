Bill of Materials
==========

[Index](index.md) -- 

*  [Bill of Materials for North America v13.04](http://labs.nortd.com/lasersaur/bom-suppliers-usd)
*  [Bill of Materials for Europe v13.04](http://labs.nortd.com/lasersaur/bom-suppliers-eur)

We provide material lists with suppliers for Europe and North America. This should make it very straight forward to order all the components needed. Since we designed the Lasersaur around standard parts for the most part, building a system outside of these areas is still possible.

The bill of materials comes in two flavors: (1) by subsystem and (2) by supplier. As you might have guessed "by supplier" is best suited for ordering all the parts. "By subsystem" is good to understand the CAD model and the various subassemblies.

The BOMs keep getting refined. See [revisions page](revisions) for details.
