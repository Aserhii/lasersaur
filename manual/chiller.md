Water Chiller
==============

We use an industrial water chiller from [ColeTech](www.cncoletech.cn). They typically come with no user manual. What follows is some extra info on chilling the laser tube.

- recommended coolant: 80% distilled water + 20% [DowFrost](http://www.dow.com/heattrans/prod/glycol/dowfrost.htm) (aka [propylene glycol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propylene_glycol)). Ethylene glycol should not be used.
- When using tap water it should be fairly well filtered, changed every six weeks or mixed with a few drops of algaecide.
- if you forget to cool the laser tube for some reason turn it off as quickly as possible. Do not start cooling an already hot tube.
