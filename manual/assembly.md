You have read the [System Overview](overview.md), [Getting Started](start.md) guide, familiarized yourself with the [BOM](bom.md), ordered, and received all the parts? Great! Time to assemble a Lasersaur.


Resources
-----------
- CAD model (exclusive to beta supporters)
- [BOM](bom.md) (by subsystem view)
- [this manual](index.md)
- [the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lasersaur)


Tools
-------

* metric hex keys (preferably [ball-point](http://www.mcmaster.com/#5709A44))
* screw drivers: medium sized Phillips, tiny flat head
* pliers and side cutter
* utility knife, the snap-off kind
* metric caliper and ruler
* soldering iron
* hot glue gun
* heat gun
* power drill and drill bits: M3, M5, M6, M16 (or 5/8")
* countersinking bit (90deg)
* hacksaw
* digital multimeter (measuring current, connectivity)
* Dremel (optionally)
* ...


General Tips
-------------

- Follow the CAD model. It's most up-to-date ([images](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stfnix/sets/72157624491114826/) are often outdated).
- In the CAD model use the Distance/Measurement tool to get all the positional specs you need.
- Use the BOM's by-subsystem view to get details on the parts.
- Think ahead when planing the next steps and familiarize yourself with all the parts (esp. screw sizes).
- Try to keep frame tolerances under 0.5mm (0.02") and build on a flat surface.
- T-slot nuts (post-assembly) may turn in the slot during assembly. By loosening and re-tightening this can be prevented. It takes a couple of minutes to get the hang of this.
which makes the connection a bit more prone to vibration 
- Tighten frame screws well but not brutally tight (tslot nuts can break at excessive torque).
- Any screws attaching acrylic parts must be lightly tightened. Otherwise the acrylic will crack (either right away or after some time).
- When you run into problems consult [the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lasersaur). A good description of what you need help with (possibly also some images) will go a long way for getting good answers.
